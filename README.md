# music-store-management-system
The Music Store Management System has to sell various musical records and each record comes with fixed stock. Maintaining all these records and making updates regularly such as number of items available, their price, number of items sold etc was not an easy task manually. As customers also are not able to search any particular record based on their requirement. Through this Music Store Management System, its admin will also be able to make necessary operations related to their customers and records. This Music Store Management System will have the ability to store the year of record, genre of the record/album, name of the record, name of the artist, price of the record per piece, quantity available in the stock.
